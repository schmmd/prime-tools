Prime Tools. Copyright (c) 2005 Michael Schmitz.

March 2005:
	1. C++ source reduced to C source.
	2. Makefile system rewritten with autoconf tools instead of Ajunta.
	3. Variable names standardized
	4. Comments reorganized
	5. primes.h created to increase modularity.

Various changes in the past years dramatically improved the algorithms used to
solve for primes but remain undocumented because they happened long ago,
before documentation (or maybe just before I cared)
