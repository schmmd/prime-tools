Prime Tools version 1.0.0
Copyright (c) 2005 Michael D. Schmitz

The Prime Tools package is composed of five programs, each with a specific
function. these programs are:

 elimination:
   find all primes less than n using a fast and memory efficient algorithm.
    
 first:
   finds the first n primes.
    
 isprime:
   determines if input x is prime.
    
 million:
   finds the first x primes and breaks the output into packages by the million
    
 prime:
   finds the first x primes

These programs began when I was still a middle school student, an eighth
grader.  Over the years they have improved much, although they still could be
far more efficient.  They exist largely as a memory of how far I have come
since the eighth grade.  I hope this project can inspire others as much as it
interested me in math and science!
